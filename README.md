AdWords Placement Problem via Online Bipartite Graph Matching

## Datasets

A small dataset called bidder_dataset.csv is used. This dataset contains information about the advertisers. There are four columns: advertiser ID, query that they bid on, bid value for that query, and their total budget (for all the keywords). The total budget is only listed once at the beginning of each advertiserâ€™s list.
In addition, the file queries.txt contains the sequence of arrivals of the keywords that the advertisers will bid on. These queries will arrive online and a fresh auctioning would be made for each keyword in this list.

## Project
Implemented ```Greedy```, ```MSVV```, and ```Balance``` algorithms.
